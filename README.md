# diceImageRecognition
The goal of the project was to design a system that, given a image of a single six-sided die, was automatically able to determine the outcome of the roll (a number in the 1â€“6 range). To do that, I designed a feature extraction procedure that extracts information from the images, I trained different classification models (Multinomial Logistic Regression, KSVM, MLP) and after analysing the behavior of the trained models I selected the best one for the purpose. Different ML libraries could have been used to complete the task (Keras, Pytorch, SciKit-learn) but I decided to use the one I created and coded during my ML course. In the analysis I also used the SciKit-learn library since at that time no KSVM models were implemented in my personal one yet.
